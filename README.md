## Description

_This Application takes in a user input as a number and runs it through a method called PingPongify. PingPongify first declares an empty output list, then uses a for loop that starts it's index at 1, runs until it reaches the user input number, and increments by 1, then the method checks if the index is divisible by 3 and adds Ping to the output list, the numbers divisible by 5 as Pong to the output list, the numbers divisible by both as Ping Pong to the output list, and if it is not divisible by either it adds the index as a string to the output list._
